        My name is Aram and I want to live in a world where security comes first, authentication is more convenient and
        coffee is in endless supply. I like to solve problems, connect dots and be in constant state of learning and optimization. 
        
        <br> <br>      
        The tech industry is need of strong leaders who are able to navigate the complicated technical 
        landscape while understanding business needs and considerations.  I make it my goal every day to improve my skills and knowledge 
        on both sides of the fence. To be successful in today’s innovative culture I believe every company needs to view themselves as a 
        technology company no matter the type of work they do.  Whether it’s built into the products or used to improve internal operations 
        embracing technology can help companies maintain and be leaders in their respective industries. In the same way business need to 
        look at technology, technology needs to have the same conversation with security. Security can no longer be a consideration but 
        a default. The next wave of successful companies will need to prioritize technology because if they don't they risk losing it all. 
        I've made it my goal to help people and organizations make the transition and push their competitive advantage even further..  

        <br> <br>
        After learning Web Design and Development during in my undergrad years I wanted to take things
        a step further and learn how to program and also secure the sites I was developing.  After starting my
         Master’s program in Cyber Security Engineering at the University of San Diego I decided to start this 
        blog to outline my journey.  In it you can find what I've have learned in and out of the
        classroom.  There are also white papers, tutorials, thoughts, curiosities, fascinations and ideas relating to Cyber Security
        and how it affects our society. I like to keep my posts quick and easy to read, however please feel free to contact me 
        for a deeper conversation.
