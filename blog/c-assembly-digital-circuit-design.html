          Welcome to the 1st official post! As I write this I am officially half way through my program at USD.  
          This post will briefly cover the courses I’ve taken thus and get this blog caught up to present day. 
          This blog will cover my journey as I transition from a security student to a security professional. 
          You will find posts related to courses I’ve taken, as well as anything tech related.  I hope you enjoy, 
          learn and find success on your own journey.

          <h5> CYBR 505 – Computational Roots of Cyber Security.<br></h5>
          In this class we learned C programming all the way down to programming logic gates.  We covered C, moved on to MIPS assembly 
          and ended with digital circuit design. In retrospect I think learning C provided a great foundation for learning how to
          program. While whether C is a high level language is arguable, learning it made understanding and learning other higher level 
          languages such as python and JavaScript easy. What impacted me the most however was understanding how a 
          program written in C was compiled and then interpreted into machine instructions. I understood that computers operated with just 1’s and 0’s 
          however, I did not fully grasp what that meant up until now. While this was one of my favorite courses thus far I look forward 
          to never having to write out a program with multi-dimensional arrays with pen and paper. 


          <h5> CYBR 500 – Foundations Cyber Security.<br></h5>
          This course was designed to get you up to speed with the Cyber Security domain and teach you the industry lingo. If 
          I could sum up this course in three letters it would be CIA.  What really resonated with me though was learning how 
          much of an edge a Cyber Security professional can gain just by having their soft skills on point. There is a lot to 
          be said about a person that is able to effectively communicate and understand both the technical 
          and business aspects of Cyber Operations.  Throughout this journey I intend to not sharpen not only my technical knowledge 
          but my capabilities as a leader, collaborator and presenter. 

          
          <h5> CYBR 560 – Secure Software System<br></h5>
          This course provided an introduction to the software development process with an emphasis on incorporating security
          from the start. We went over basics such as waterfall vs agile methods and creating UML diagrams.  We were put into teams 
          develop a software program from start to finish. This was a valuable exercise in learning about the various duties, process
          and documentation involved with creating software. The software we were tasked with creating was a program could take in 
          coordinates in any format and ensure they were converted to +/- DD.DDDDD°, +/- DDD.DDDDD° format, then store them for retrieval 
          by other software components. For example, 32° 18' 23.1" N 122° 36' 52.5" W could be taken in and converted to +32.30642, -122.61458, 
          stored, then retrieved by another program when requested. I was tasked with writing test cases and testing the software for bugs
          and security vulnerabilities. My biggest takeaway from this job was learning how to develop software with test driven development in mind.
          My team members Austin Miller and Katie Lavieri wrote the program in Java and deployed it as a web application in a Heroku Cloud 
          environment.  We used Postman to communicate with the app using Get and Post commands.  You can view the program and Austin and Katie's 
          GitHub accounts in the links below.

          <h5> CYBR 570 – Operating Systems Design <br></h5>
          In this course we covered the design and implementation of how operating systems function from a low level perspective with topics
          including memory management, CPU scheduling algorithms, multi-threading, swap space management, file systems and kernel modules. We also 
          covered gaining root access with advanced exploits such as buffer overflow attacks and race condition vulnerabilities. While I was no 
          stranger to Linux prior to this course I developed a special kind of muscle and mind connection with the tab and the up arrow key.
