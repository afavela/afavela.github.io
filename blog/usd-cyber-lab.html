            In addition to attending USD as a master’s student I also work on campus full time as a Audio Visual Technician.  One 
            of the best benefits of working at USD is the tuition remission program which allows you to take one undergrad or graduate
            program on the house. The school of Engineering at USD recently received a donation to build out an un used section of the engineering
            building with labs and classrooms including a Cyber Security Lab. As an AV tech part of my job is to assist with the design and 
            spec of the AV gear that go into all academic spaces on campus.  I love this part of my job and working on the Cyber Security Lab 
            was a special treat.  The Cyber Lab has the most advanced gear and capabilities of any space on campus.  I designed the layout
            for the control system and specified the necessary programming. The main star of the show is the 16x16 video matrix switcher.  It allows 
            you to route any source to any 4 of the 80' displays. The displays are setup pairs, one horizontal one vertical.  The idea in 
            mind was to make viewing source code and spec sheets easier. There are seven student pod stations that allow you to hookup a laptop
            and display it on any of the screens.  The lab opens for classes starting in the fall (next week) and I am quite excited to see 
            the space in use.  I really enjoyed working on a project where I had some real skin in the game and also opened my eyes to the possibly
            of pursuing this combination of audio visual and cyber security in a professional capacity
